# APEX

Apex is a priopritory language developed by salesforce to allow us to write the code that executes on salesforce platform. It is strongly typed language so we need to define every datatype before declaring a variable. It is processed very similar to java. It is first complied to byte code and then bytecode is run by interpreter.
